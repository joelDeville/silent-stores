This file is general practices to follow when writing benchmarks for varying types of systems

For programming machines with varying word sizes (32 or 64 bit machines, specifically ROR on ARM),
Use sizeof macro to determine size of point to know what to subtract by to emulate rotate right
- Due to ARM only implementing rotate left, so rotate right is really ROL word_ize - shift_amt

In general, try to do instruction-based checking of cycle registers (if possible) to incur system call
