Note: if running into error with not finding libtinfo.so file for Vivado lab, run 'sudo apt install libtinfo5'
Make sure Ubuntu 20.04 is in use

To set up FireSim:
    1. Follow directions to set up users in Ubuntu for FireSim management
        3a. Go to 'Local FPGA System Setup' and follow the all instructions (sudo and non-sudo setup)
        3b. This can be done on the latest version of FireSim
        3c. This also goes through installing Vivado lab and cable drivers, step two could be omitted (except for shortcut convenience) unless errors occur
        3d. Make sure to rerun SSH instructions (in non-sudo) section before running FireSim
    2. Download Vivado Lab
        1a. Create desktop .sh file with following content to allow shortcut-like behavior:
            #!/bin/bash
            source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado_Lab/2024.2/settings64.sh
            vivado_lab -journal ../Documents/Vivado-Lab/vivado_lab.jou -log ../Documents/Vivado-Lab/vivado_lab.log
    3. Follow FireSim directions to initialize and download drivers (specifically cable drivers) for NiteFury
    	2a. Run 'install drivers' script in Vivado Lab installation directory to install correct drivers
    	- look in ${vivado_install_dir}/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/
        - Keep JTAG cable plugged in at all times as this is used by FireSim
        - make sure to ALWAYS source 'sourceme-manager.sh' as described on the website when using Firesim in Chipyard
    4. Follow specific FPGA Chipyard instructions to install Firesim with Chipyard and initialize it
        4a. Temporary simulation directory will be created
        4b. Also must log IP of manager machine (same as run machine in my case) and FPGA machine_spec (detailed in Firesim tutorial)
