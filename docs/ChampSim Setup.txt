ChampSim is another microarchitecture simulator which supports multicore and multithreading use cases
- meant to provide more data for this benchmark

Fun fact: ChampSim allows configuration with data prefetchers, branch predictors, and replacement policies

To setup ChampSim:
    1. Follow directions in its GitHub to install any dependencies
    2. Define any configs desired in the example configuration file (will work with defaults otherwise)
    3. Download any desired traces to use in simulator (since it is trace-based)
    4. Run simulator on these traces
