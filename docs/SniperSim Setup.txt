SniperSim is another microarchitecture simulator which supports multicore and multithreading
- useful for gathering more data for this benchmark

To set up SniperSim:
    1. Follow directions on their GitHub (links to their website to get started)
        1a. May not have to send info to get link, just try cloning the repo straight
    2. Download Intel's PIN software (a dynamic binary instrumentation tool)
        2a. Move and rename folder as "pin_kit" in sniper's folder
    3. Run 'make -j N' with N being the number of CPUs on the machine to build SniperSim
        3a. Run command below if running into error while building saying "unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++20’; did you mean ‘-std=c++2a’"
        3b. sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-10 /usr/local/bin/g++ (creates symink between running g++ and actually going to g++-10)
        3c. This makes sure the new configurations are actually valid in the script (only valid in g++-10 and beyond, not g++-9)
