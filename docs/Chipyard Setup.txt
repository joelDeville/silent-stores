To set up Chipyard (for BOOM and Rocket):
    1. install conda
    2. go to chipyard website and follow instructions
        2a. set version of website to match repo (1.11.0)
        2b. make sure to install libmamba-solver and conda-lock
        2c. make sure latest version is downloaded (if initial installation causes errors)
    3. clone chipyard and check out HEAD (or latest, stable release)
        3a. Use 1.11.0 release for stable version
        3b. in chipyard directory, run 'sudo chown <username> -R .' to move all ownership from root to your user (useful to build-setup.sh)
    3. install libmamba (using conda)
    4. run build command (not using sudo, with relevant skipping instructions to skip any FireMarshal configurations)
        4a. skip marshal first time (--skip-marshal)
        4b. if rerunning, make sure .conda-env environment active in condas and run with --skip-conda too
    5. activate .conda-env environment in chipyard directory for variables
    6. after finishing build (and in general), always run 'source env.sh' before using 'make' for anything
    7. continue instructions for running binary for BOOM/Rocket on custom tests
