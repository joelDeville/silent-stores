To set up Chipyard (for BOOM and Rocket):
    1. install conda
    2. go to chipyard website and follow instructions
        2a. make sure to install libmamba-solver and conda-lock
    3. clone chipyard and check out HEAD (or latest, stable release)
        3a. Use 1.11.0 release for stable version
    3. install libmamba (using conda)
    4. run build command (with relevant skipping instructions to skip any FireMarshal configurations)
        4a. skip marshal and conda initialization (--skip-marshal, --skip-conda)
    5. after finishing build (and in general), always run 'source env.sh' before using 'make' for anything
    6. continue instructions for running binary for BOOM/Rocket on custom tests
