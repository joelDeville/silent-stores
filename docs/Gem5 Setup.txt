To set up gem5 simulator:
    1. go to gem5 website (and make sure to clone pandora repo)
    2. run relevant instruction according to OS
    3. follow instructions (such as scons) to build then subsequently run gem5 build
    4. make sure to use 'sudo' when building gem5
    5. download and run 'configure' on libsodium (stable release)
    6. modify run & build_gem5 scripts to be executable
    7. go into workloads directory for silent store and modify makefile to point to correct location for built gem5 and libsodium
        7a. look in simulator/util for m5 directories and whatnot for makefile
        7b. link libsodium-stable version via relative path for makefile
    8. continue instructions on running simulator on custom tests
